<div id="Grinding brakes" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Grinding brakes</h3>
  <p>If your brakes are grinding, it means something's wrong with them. It usually happens when the brake pads wear down and start scraping against the metal brake rotors. This can make it harder to stop your car and might damage the rotors. It's important to get your brakes checked and fixed to keep your car safe and working well.</p>
</div>

<div id="Bad alternator" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Bad alternator</h3>
  <p>When an alternator is bad, your car's battery won't charge properly, leading to issues like dim lights, trouble starting the engine, or even the car stalling while driving. It can also cause warning lights to come on, problems with electrical systems, and in severe cases, the car may lose power completely. It's important to fix a bad alternator quickly to avoid more significant problems.</p> 
</div>

<div id="Blown transmission" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Blown transmission</h3>
  <p>A blown transmission is a serious issue in a car's drivetrain. It typically occurs due to overheating, lack of maintenance, or mechanical failure. Symptoms include difficulty shifting gears, strange noises, slipping gears, or the car not moving at all. Driving with a blown transmission can cause further damage and may result in costly repairs. It's crucial to address transmission issues promptly to avoid extensive damage and ensure safe operation of the vehicle.</p>
